# CS-305
Repository created for Module 8 of CS-305 Software Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
While working at "Global Rain" Development company I assisted with a project for Artemis Financial. We assisted in updating and assisting their software security to help maintain the security for their clients by doing dependency checks, choosing the best cipher algorithms, generating security certificates, and maintaining secure communications via HTTPS.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I think the dependency check and suppression was done well. I had lots of practice and this step required a lot of time relative to everything else. 
Secure code is paramount to any company that develops software. For Financial institutions, like Artemis, security is paramount in the health and success of the company. Without secure code, clients would have no faith in the company and would not do business with them. Secure code gives clients confidence that their information is safe and that the company can handle their information safely and responsibly.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The Certificate Generation took a little bit for me to understand, but after working with the program and figuring it out, it was not only the quickest, but also the most tangible product of the code.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Utilizing cipher algorithms is a staple in the security industry. For the future, if Maven is an option, I would use that since I am now familiar with it. I will do more research in the field for other dependency/vulnerability checks and could also utilize a second encryption cipher for information if needed.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After doing the dependency checks and suppressions, running a new dependency check ensured that I was not introducing more vulnerabilities. Another good practice is to address problems in steps. After getting the working code, I ran every change to ensure that the outcomes agreed with expectations.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Maven assisted with this project by performing the dependency checks. The Eclipse IDE also assisted with this as Maven checks are incorporated natively into the client.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The certificate generation as it seems to be the main thing from this class that I didn't know before AND is the most tangible/relevant product.
